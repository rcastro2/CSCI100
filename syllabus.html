			<h4 class="card-title">General Education and Departmental Requirements</h4>
			<p class="card-text">This is a general education course that may be used to satisfy the Scientific World (SW) requirement under the CUNY Pathways
				General Education structure. The course can also be used to satisfy the Natural Science (NS) requirement for students
				who matriculated under the Perspectives curriculum that was in effect at Queens before CUNY introduced Pathways.</p>

			<p class="card-text">See the <a href="https://gened.qc.cuny.edu/" target="_blank">General Education website</a> for more information about
				the General Education requirements at the College.</p>

			<p class="card-text">The course is offered by the Computer Science Department, and may be used as an elective in the Computer Information Technology
				(CIT) minor. It does not count as part of the computer science BA or BS majors.</p>

	<div class="card">
		<div class="card-body">
			<h4 class="card-title">Required Background</h4>
			<p class="card-text">The course has no other courses as prerequisites: you are not expected to have ever written any code, and you don’t need
				any mathematical preparation beyond high school algebra. What you do need is an openness to new ideas, a willingness
				to think about how our digital world works, and an interest in creating something new. The Arduino programming language
				used in this course is actually the same programming language (C++) as the language used in CSCI-111, the first course
				in the Computer Science majors. (Arduino has a different “runtime environment” from C++, but the languages are the same.)
				Because the Arduino programming environment is so different from the C++ environment used in CSCI-111, students who have
				completed a C++ course equivalent to CSCI-111 are allowed to take this course despite the overlap. But students with
				more programming experience are not allowed to take it. Those students are encouraged to learn Arduino on their own!</p>

			<p class="card-text">Time: Wednesdays 4pm to 7pm<br>Location: Science Building Room B-141 (First class, midterm and final) and Science Building
				A205 (all other class meetings)</p>
			<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-1 mt-4 text-muted">Text, hardware and software</h6>
			<p class="card-text">There is no textbook required for this course. All tutorial and reference resources for the course is available online
				at no cost. Hardware is available in SB A205 for use during class and open lab hours. You and a partner from the course
				will be given the combination to one of the lockers, where you can keep your lab materials to use outside of class time.
				Though not required for the course, the Adruino Circuit Playground Classic is available through <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3000"
				 target="_blank">Adafruit</a> for only $19.95 but they are currently out of stock. In terms of software, you may download
				and install the integrated development environment (IDE) or use the browser based IDE. Both versions are available at

			<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-1 mt-4 text-muted">Workload</h6>
			<p class="card-text">Attendance is important as assignments and quizzes will be based on the information and work covered in class. You should
				expect to spend at least three hours a week reviewing the information covered in class and completing assignments. During
				the project phase there will be no assignments or quizzes but expect to spend an equal amount of time if not more working
				with your group to complete the project. You will be given time in class to work with your groups on your projects.</p>
			<p class="card-text">Quizzes are used as a check of knowledge of the material covered in that particular class meeting. Quizzes will be administered
				at the end of each class meeting. Assignments serve as a reinforcement and extension of the information covered in class.
				You will be expected to do some exploration and investigation in order to complete assignments. Do not hestitate to reach
				out for assistances. Assignments submission will be discussed in class.</p>
			<p class="card-text">Active learning will be the key to your success. Embrace the class and activities presented. Take scrupulous notes. Ask
				questions. Be creative. Be <a onclick="$('#easteregg').modal('show');">motivated.</a> </p>

			<h4 class="card-title">Goal</h4>
			<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-3 text-muted">What is information, and how do we process information when we think?</h6>

			<p class="card-text">Queens College is a liberal arts college, which means in part that you should expect to develop “critical thinking” abilities
				while you are here. At the same time, there is a push for everyone to learn “computational thinking” (usually in the
				form of learning to code) because that sort of thinking is core to so much of what we do in both our social and our work
				lives.</p>

			<p class="card-text">In order to develop these skills you will learn to write code that makes small electronic devices (microcontrollers) interact
				with the physical world. The electronic devices you will be using are called Arduinos, along with a C-based programming
				language. You can think of code writing as teaching a computer how to use information to solve problems. What makes this
				approach so good for achieving the goals of this course is that the process of teaching computers will help you develop
				your own ability to think analytically and critically, and that type of thinking is the hallmark of a liberal arts education.</p>
